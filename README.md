# Zendesk_Rest_API_Export_All_Tickets
You can use the Zendesk REST API with Python to read, update, and create data in your Zendesk product. 
The code in this repo uses **import requests** package to:

- grab all the tickets from Zendesk ( in json format)
- filter them based on desired conditions
- export in .csv 


A tutorial for *requests* Python package can be found [here](https://help.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/229136887-Zendesk-REST-API-tutorial-Python-edition)


Another more easy-to-use package is [Zenpy](http://docs.facetoe.com.au/)
